# VizServe
VizServe is a simple, REST-based visualization server, which makes it really easy to quickly get insight into your data through visualizations. VizServe aims to support both static and streaming data, and aims to be easily extendable with new visualizations. A database supports VizServe in order to provide persistency. At the moment, this database is PostgreSQL, but the modular design makes it relatively painless to switch to a different database of your choice.
